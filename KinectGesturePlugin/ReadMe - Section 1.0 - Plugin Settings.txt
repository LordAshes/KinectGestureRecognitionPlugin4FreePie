1.0 PLUGIN SETTINGS:

There plugin offers two simple settings which can be set prior to using the plugin.

1.1. Use Gexture File

This is a checkable setting which determines if the plugin should automatically load gestures from an
external XML file or not. When the setting is checked, the plugin loads the indicated (see next setting)
XML file on plugin startup. It should be noted that the same can be accomplished from the script by
using the associated method but checking this setting causes the load to occur automatically without
needing any script code to do so.

1.2. Gesture File

Although this setting is always available, it is only applicable is the previous settings is checked.
In such a case this setting indicates the file name (or location and file name) of the gesture XML file
that is to be automatically loaded when the plugin is started. If the previous setting is unchecked,
this setting is ignored.
